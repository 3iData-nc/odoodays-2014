Odoo Days 2014, R&D presentations
=================================

* install hieroglyph >= 0.6.5
* create a directory named after your presentation
* add an index.rst file to it
* ``make dir=$directory slides``
* the result is in ``$directory/_build/slides``

Then look at demo/ for instructions on how things work (``make dir=demo slides
html`` can help)

Push your presentation slides (and others) to this repository so it's
available to e.g. print out.

If you *need* specific graphical features missing from default Sphinx or the
custom stylesheet, open an issue.
